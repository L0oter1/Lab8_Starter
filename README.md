## How are graceful degredation and service workers related?
Service Workers help you achieve graceful degradation. When there is a computer problem or network outage, your program shouldn't completely crash but instead gracefully degrade or function on a lower level but it should still be functional. With Service workers, you can achieve this by allowing packets you've already obtained through the network to be stored on your local storage. Then Service workers can use the local storage to create a somewhat still operating platform as long as you don't need to receive new packets through the internet.
